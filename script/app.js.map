等分的原则进行划分。</p>\\n<p>划分之后的信息区块我们称之为『盒子』。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。『盒子』在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。</p>\\n<h2

24，那么多余的<code>col</code>会作为一个整体另起一行排列</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"flex-\\\">Flex 布局</h2>\\n<p>我们的栅格化系统支持 Flex 布局，允许子元素在父节点内的水平对齐方式 - 居左、居中、居右、等宽排列、分散排列。子元素与子元素之间，支持顶部对齐、垂直居中对齐、底部对齐的方式。同时，支持使用 order 来定义元素的排列顺序。</p>\\n<p>Flex 布局是基于 24 栅格来定义每一个『盒子』的宽度，但排版则不拘泥于栅格。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">属性</h2>\\n<h3

来定义元素的排列顺序。</p>\\n<p>Flex 布局是基于 24 栅格来定义每一个『盒子』的宽度，但排版则不拘泥于栅格。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">属性</h2>\\n<h3
