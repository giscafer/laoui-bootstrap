等分的原则进行划分。</p>\\n<p>划分之后的信息区块我们称之为『盒子』。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。『盒子』在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">概述</h2>\\n<p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>通过<code>row</code>在水平方向建立一组<code>column</code>（简写col）</li>\\n<li>你的内容应当放置于<code>col</code>内，并且，只有<code>col</code>可以作为<code>row</code>的直接元素</li>\\n<li>栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽的列可以使用<code>.col-8</code>来创建</li>\\n<li>如果一个<code>row</code>中的<code>col</code>总和超过 24，那么多余的<code>col</code>会作为一个整体另起一行排列</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"flex-\\\">Flex 布局</h2>\\n<p>我们的栅格化系统支持 Flex 布局，允许子元素在父节点内的水平对齐方式 - 居左、居中、居右、等宽排列、分散排列。子元素与子元素之间，支持顶部对齐、垂直居中对齐、底部对齐的方式。同时，支持使用 order 来定义元素的排列顺序。</p>\\n<p>Flex 布局是基于 24 栅格来定义每一个『盒子』的宽度，但排版则不拘泥于栅格。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">属性</h2>\\n<h3

等分的原则进行划分。</p>\\n<p>划分之后的信息区块我们称之为『盒子』。建议横向排列的盒子数量最多四个，最少一个。『盒子』在整个屏幕上占比见上图。设计部分基于盒子的单位定制盒子内部的排版规则，以保证视觉层面的舒适感。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">概述</h2>\\n<p>布局的栅格化系统，我们是基于行（row）和列（col）来定义信息区块的外部框架，以保证页面的每个区域能够稳健地排布起来。下面简单介绍一下它的工作原理：</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>通过<code>row</code>在水平方向建立一组<code>column</code>（简写col）</li>\\n<li>你的内容应当放置于<code>col</code>内，并且，只有<code>col</code>可以作为<code>row</code>的直接元素</li>\\n<li>栅格系统中的列是指1到24的值来表示其跨越的范围。例如，三个等宽的列可以使用<code>.col-8</code>来创建</li>\\n<li>如果一个<code>row</code>中的<code>col</code>总和超过 24，那么多余的<code>col</code>会作为一个整体另起一行排列</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"flex-\\\">Flex 布局</h2>\\n<p>我们的栅格化系统支持 Flex 布局，允许子元素在父节点内的水平对齐方式 - 居左、居中、居右、等宽排列、分散排列。子元素与子元素之间，支持顶部对齐、垂直居中对齐、底部对齐的方式。同时，支持使用 order 来定义元素的排列顺序。</p>\\n<p>Flex 布局是基于 24 栅格来定义每一个『盒子』的宽度，但排版则不拘泥于栅格。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">属性</h2>\\n<h3
